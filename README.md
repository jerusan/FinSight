# FinSight

FinSight is an AI-powered financial insights platform that helps users analyze bank statements and assess financial health. It provides a modern dashboard for visualizing and understanding key financial metrics, making it especially useful for loan officers, financial advisors, and individuals seeking deeper insights into their finances.

## MVP
This project demonstrates a **loan approval support system**:

### 1. üè¶ Bank Statement Upload  
The underwriter uploads a bank statement in PDF format.

### 2. üîç Transaction Parsing & Verification  
The system parses the PDF and extracts transaction data.  
The underwriter must review the entries and fix any errors, such as:
- Mismatched balances  
- Formatting issues  
- Missing data
- The left side shows parsed transactions, right side shows the original PDF.

### 3. üìä Financial Insights Dashboard  
Once verified, the system generates a detailed financial overview, including:
- Total income and monthly breakdown  
- Spending categories and patterns  
- Cash flow trends  
- Risk flags and loan affordability metrics

### 4. ü§ñ Finance Assistant (Q&A Chat bot)  
Users can interact with a built-in assistant to ask follow-up questions like:
- ‚ÄúWhat are the recurring payments?‚Äù
- ‚ÄúHow much was spent on groceries last month?‚Äù


This streamlines the underwriting process and helps assess financial health efficiently.
## Features
- **Bank Statement Upload**: Upload PDF bank statements for instant analysis.
- **Automated Data Extraction**: Parses transactions and account activity using AI and PDF extraction tools.
- **Financial Insights Dashboard**: Visualizes income, spending, cash flow stability, balance trends, loan affordability, and risk flags.
- **Interactive Table**: Review and edit extracted transactions before finalizing analysis.
- **AI Chat Assistant**: Ask questions about the financial data and receive contextual answers.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js (React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Recharts, Lucide Icons)
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python 3.11), PDFPlumber, Pandas, OpenAI API
- **Containerization**: Docker, Docker Compose
